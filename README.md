![](images/weatherdashboard.png) 

## Assignment objectives:

The purpose of this assignment was  to create a weather dashboard which projected the 5 day forecast from a selected city. This included the temperature, humidity, and weather for each day.  https://brianlevin.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
## Syntax Used
For this assignment, I used html and css to display the weather dashboard syntax and styling onto the website. I then created a API for the weather.org and made an Ajax  call to fetch the 5 day forecasts for the city. I used pure Javascript for the if else statements and Jquery to append the api data onto the page. I also used a Moment.js to append the day month and year. I used Jquery to append the temperature and the humidity 



## What I learned

I learned how to get an API Key and then use an ajax call to append  the api key for to get weather.. I then learned additional Jquery to append the specific weather response onto the page.
